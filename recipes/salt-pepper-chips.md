Salt & pepper chips are a common dish you'll find in most British Chinese restaurants. They're lovely on their own but work better as part of a dinner. They're pretty versatile but work best with other Chinese-inspired dishes. 

### Ingredients
- 3 tbsp cooking oil (something with a high smoke point is better)
- 300g-500g frozen oven chips
- 1 onion
- 1 green bell pepper (if you can't get hold of green, use any other colour)
- 1 red chilli
- 1 tsp Chinese 5 spice
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/4 tsp white pepper
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp MSG
- 1 tsp sugar

### Steps
If the quality of your oven chips are anything like mine, then they're usually not very good cooked dry. Put 2 tbsp of oil into a deep roasting dish, then put it in your oven while it preheats. A few minutes after the oven gets to temp, take the tray out and throw in the chips. Give it a good shake to spread the oil around and then cook according to the packaging instructions, but usually 30 minutes at 200C will do it.

While the chips are cooking dice your onion and bell pepper, de-seed the chilli and slice it up. Throw them all together in the same bowl.

To prep your seasoning mix just add all the powders together.

When there is about 5 minutes left on the oven timer take out a frying pan and heat up the remaining 1 tbsp of oil. Once hot, toss in the veg mix and stir fry it until the onion and bell peppers are slightly browned and soft. If your pan is big enough, throw in the chips and the spice mix and stir it up. If it isn't, do the same but throw the veg mix and spices into the roasting pan you cooked the chips in and stir through.

Done!
