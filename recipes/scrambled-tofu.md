If you've never tried tofu before this might sound gross, but hear me out. Tofu, as is often said, takes on the flavour of whatever you're cooking it with. That's true, but it does actually have a nice taste of its own. It's also very crumbly and scrambles very well!

### Ingredients
- 200g-300g tofu (any works, but I prefer extra firm)
- Salt & pepper to taste
The rest of the ingredients are optional but highly recommended
- Butter, or vegan alternative
- Onion
- Bread/Toast

### Steps
Pat the tofu dry with some paper towels and leave to one side.

Dice the onion if you haven't already.

Add a little butter (or alternative) to a frying pan, heat, and once hot add the onion. Fry until golden. Add the tofu to the pan and mash it into crumbs and stir through. While the tofu fries, toast your bread if you want to.

Once the tofu is looking a little fried, add some salt & pepper if you want to.

Finally, pour it over the toast and serve. I won't judge you if you want to squirt some ketchup on top, that's pretty good too!
