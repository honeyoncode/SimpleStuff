### Ingredients
For the stew:
- 200g smoked streaky bacon
- 2 medium onions, sliced
- 2 garlic cloves, crushed
- 850g braising steak
- 500ml real ale
- 500ml beef stock
- 1 tbsp tomato purée
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 tsp mixed herbs
- 2 tbsp cornflour, blended with 2 tbsp cold water
- 250g chestnut mushrooms, halved or quartered if large
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 pinch black pepper

### Steps
Slice the onions, wash the mushrooms, dice the bacon and crush the garlic cloves. Preheat the oven to 180C.

Heat 1 tbsp oil in a casserole dish or cast iron pot. Fry the bacon and onion until softened. Add the garlic and steak, then sprinkle over the salt and pepper. Cook until the beef is fully browned.

Add the ale, beef stock, tomato purée, bay leaves and herbs and mix well. Bring it to a boil, then cover and cook in the oven for 1 ½ hours - 2 hours, or until the meat is very tender.

Remove from the oven, stir in the cornflour paste, then cook on the hob until the sauce thickens.

Heat 1 tbsp oil in a frying pan and fry the mushrooms over a high heat until crispy and golden. Add them to the strew.

I usually serve this with steamed broccoli and buckwheat groats.
