### Ingredients
- 600g chicken (I recommend bone-in chicken thighs)
- 1 carrot
- Roughly 20cm of leek
- Parsley root (Hard to find in the UK, sometimes I use parsnip instead)
- Celery root
- Ground pepper
- Vegeta spice (vegetable spice, found in Polish sections of shops)
    - Use salt or vegetable boullion if you cannot find vegeta spice.

### Steps
Fill a saucepan with 2.5L of water and add the chicken whilst the water is still cold. Turn on the heat to high and remove the foam when it appears - The soup will be cloudy without this step. 

When the foam has disappeared add the vegetables, vegetable spice, and ground pepper. If you are not using vegetable spice add a bit of salt.

Leave it on a low heat for approximately 1.5 hours.

Once cooked, use a slotted spoon to remove the chicken. With the veg you have options - Some people cut them up and return them to the soup, others remove them entirely and discard them, and others will use a blender to blend the veg into the soup. It's your call.

As for the chicken, rather than wasting it I recommend you shred it. I keep this in a bowl in the fridge to fry the next day. Itâ€™s great in butter!
