This is a slightly modified recipe that as far as I know originally came from a TikTok account called "laurenleyva".

### Ingredients
- 10 large tomatoes
- 6 medium tomatoes
- 2 red peppers
- 8 garlic cloves
- Handful of fresh basil
- 1 vegetable stock cube
- 600ml water
- Olive oil

### Steps
Preheat the oven to 200C. Peel the garlic cloves and cut all the tomatoes in half. Roughly chop the peppers.

Add the tomatoes, peppers, garlic, and a drizzle of olive oil to a large deep baking tray or roasting tin. Season with salt and pepper then roast in the oven for 25 minutes.

By this point the tomatoes should have burst and the pan covered in juice. Pour the tray into a large pot, along with 600ml vegetable stock. Bring to boil and simmer for 5 minutes.

Add a little fresh basil if you want to, then stir through. Add some salt & pepper to taste if it needs it.

Finally, use a blender to blitz it until smooth.

Serve with crusty buttered bread!
