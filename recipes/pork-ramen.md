This recipe is all about making something tasty really quicky and cheaply. At its most basic, just use the two packs of ramen mixed together but if you can afford to and have the energy I recommend adding a protein and some veg. This is supposed to serve two, but if you're doing it for one then just split it in half and keep one half in the fridge for the next day or something.

I like spicy food, but not _too_ spicy, and a lot of the time I find spicy ramen overpowering. The trick here is mixing it with sesame ramen, which is equally delicious and not at all spicy, resulting in a great flavour combo.

### Ingredients
- 1 pack of spicy ramen*
- 1 pack of sesame ramen*
- around 250g pork belly, diced (tofu will work too!)
- Veg of choice (frozen peas, frozen stir fry mix, bok choy, anything works)

\* I use Demae Ramen, other brands would be fine too, as would other flavours if you don't like these.

### Steps
Dice the pork belly if you haven't already. Add a little bit of oil to a pan (you don't need much, the pork's fat will melt and help fry it) and then heat it up. Add the pork belly and fry until fully cooked.

While the pork is still frying, fill a pan with water and bring it to boil. Add both packs of dry noodles to the water once it's boiling.

If you're using frozen veg, I'd take the pork out of the pan and then add the frozen veg and fry. If it's not frozen then don't bother taking out the pork. Just fry them together now.

When the ramen has cooked (it'll only take a couple of minutes) you need to make a choice: How watery do you want this to be? Fully drain the ramen if you like it dry, or retain a little water to make a little sauce, or keep a lot if you want this to be ramen soup.

Add both seasoning pouches and mix well. Add the pork belly and veg. Serve!
