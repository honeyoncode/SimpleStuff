## Welcome!

Welcome to Simple Stuff, a collection of things.

Want to leave immediately? Head over to the [directory](/directory) to find somewhere to go.

## About Simple Stuff

Simple Stuff is a collection of things I found interesting and decided to either store them directly (things like recipes) or link to them (like the directory). Over time it should grow to be a great source of information that is managed by people and not algorithms.

## About Me
I am a 30-something software engineer from the UK. I'm fond of the old web, when everybody had a blog and the internet was owned by the people instead of businesses. 

Wanna get in touch? Find me on [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/honeylake.bsky.social).

## References
- Font used throughout the site is Open Sans.

## Repo
See how the sausage is made. The [Simple Stuff](https://github.com/honeyoncode/SimpleStuff) repo is open for viewing, but closed for contribution (for the time being).

## Updates
- 2025-01-30: Added some sections to the directory. Moved "About" content to the homepage, deleted "About".
- 2025-01-29: Created the site, published with a few basic recipes and site layout.
