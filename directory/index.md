### Social media
Alternatives to "the big ones", these are federated instances of cool social media.

- [Bluesky](https://bsky.app) - Not part of "The Fediverse", but technically federated because it uses the AT protocol.
- [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/) - A nice alternative to Bluesky that uses the ActivityPub protocol, which means it is part of the wider fediverse.
- [Beehaw](https://beehaw.org/) - Also using ActivityPub, but instead of the microblogging approach that Bluesky and Mastodon take, Beehaw uses a more Reddit-like styling, based on an open source Reddit alternative called Lemmy.

### Gaming & gaming news
- [itch.io](https://itch.io/) - Indie games, lots for free or cheap.
- [debug](https://www.teamdebug.com/magazine) - A physical & physical gaming magazine with particular focus on indie games. Releases quarterly.

### Food, cooking, recipes
- [Me!](/recipes) - I post recipes here too. These are either recipes of my own creation or recipes I've adapted from elsewhere. Recipes from elsewhere will usually contain the original source.
- [Just One Cookbook](https://www.justonecookbook.com/) - Really great source of Japanese cooking.
- [Budget Bytes](https://www.budgetbytes.com/) - How to eat well for less.
- [RecipeTin Eats](https://www.recipetineats.com/) - Lots of recipes from all different types of cuisine.
